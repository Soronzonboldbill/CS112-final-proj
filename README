SETTING UP PAC FILE

Create a file that ends with a .pac extension. There is an example of this in the repo and 
that can be used for setup.

PAC (Proxy Auto Configuration) Files are used to specify that all traffic going to a certain domain 
must go through another source. In this case, it's the mitm proxy that was created.

Assumes that the network proxy is running on port 8080. 

on MacOS (unsure what the process is on Windows or linux):
  - host this file on localhost on a port that is not 8080 (instructions below)
  - go to settings->network->current_wifi->details->proxies->auto proxy config
    - enter the following info into settings:
    - URL: http:127.0.0.1:8081/wikipedia.pac
    - press Ok

serve this file using the following command: `python3 -m http.server 8081 --directory .`
  - assumes that python is installed on the system
  - you can also do this using node using serve or http-server.


SETTING UP THE MITMPROXY

Follow these instructions: https://github.com/mitmproxy/mitmproxy/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md
up until the testing section. 

I think that you need to have the browser trust the mitmproxy certicate located at it's 
config or application directory. (.mitmproxy/[cert file]). I don't remember which cert file 
is required to be trusted so just try them and something should work. 

Then take the python files within the github repo and place them within the generated 
repo: mitmproxy/mitmproxy/addons

Then run the following command: mitmproxy -s chatbot_addon.py 

if everything goes well, there should be a server serving just the .pac file and another 
server just running the mitmproxy proxy.
